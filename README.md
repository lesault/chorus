*My DIY chorded keyboard*

This will be a learning project for me. 

The plan is to:
* use a Teensy USB development board as the keyboard controller.
* use mechanical keyboard switches and keycaps for the buttons
* print a suitable case with my Anet A8 3D printer
* use chords based on those used on the MicroWriter AgendA (as I have used them previously)
* write as much of the code as I can myself
* investigate further improvements such as text expansion if memory constraints allow
* post schematics, 3d printer files, code, and build instructions
