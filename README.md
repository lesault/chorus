*My DIY chorded keyboard*

This will be a learning project for me. 

The plan is to:
* use a Teensy USB development board as the keyboard controller.
* use mechanical keyboard switches and keycaps for the buttons
* print a suitable case with my Anet A8 3D printer
* use chords based on those used on the MicroWriter AgendA (as I have used them previously)
* write as much of the code as I can myself
* investigate further improvements such as text expansion if memory constraints allow
* post schematics, 3d printer files, code, and build instructions

**Parts list:**
* PLA filament for case
* Solid core hookup wire
* Solder
* 1 x Teensy 2.0 development board
* 7 x mx-style keyboard switches
* 6 x standard blank keycaps
* 1 x larger  blank keycap (e.g. shift)
* 1 x Mini-B USB cable

**Future development**
* Quieter, lighter switches - this is quite noisy and tiring to use - would be better with rubber switches, I think.
* LEDs to show which mode the keyboard is in. The 'all keys release all' chord helps cancel all pressed buttons.
* A timer to automatically cancel all held buittons if nothing is pressed in say, 5 seconds.
* A chord to allow insertion of common word parts -ing, -ation, etc.
* The 3 thumb keys might be better rotated 90 degrees anticlockwise to make pressing 1 and 3 together easier.
